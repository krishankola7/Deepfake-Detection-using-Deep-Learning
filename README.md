Detecting Deepfakes: A Deep Learning Approach with ResNeXt and LSTM
Securing DIgital Content-

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting deepfake videos using a hybrid model that combines ResNeXt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system extracts spatial features from video frames using ResNeXt and captures temporal dependencies with LSTM, enabling accurate detection of manipulated content. Trained on large-scale datasets, the model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix. By leveraging AI-driven detection techniques, this project aims to enhance digital media integrity and combat the growing threat of deepfake misinformation.
